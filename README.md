# Soil-Analysis Through Autonomous Drone

## Idea brief
Accuracy innovation has driven the cultivating upheaval lately. Checking crops from the sky
utilizing rural automatons looks set to drive the following, as agronomists, horticultural
specialists and ranchers go to UAVs (or UAS) to acquire productive yield bits of knowledge and
to all the more precisely design and deal with their activities.

## Technology being used
For the autonomous making of drones in the Agricultural fields using al, Machine learning,
augmented relationship, and lOT based machine leading smart flight controllers with telemetry
as well as GPS will be used, and autonomous drone will be planned with the software mission
planner we will create a powertool new platform in agriculture.

## Intended approach
Main aim is to make an autonomous drone which helps to capture real time and payload
dropping. Secondly a model is trained using convolutional neural networks. MobileNet is used
with imagenet as dataset to load pre trained weights.
